<h3>08-Feb-2005</h3>
<p>New 0.2.0 version, compatible with VideoLAN Client v0.8.1.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Many changes in the code to comply with the new VLC API structure first introduced in v0.8.0.
  <li>Tried to keep the source code as similar as possible to the original VLC file access module.
  <li>Left all platform specific code intact in the sources, in the hopes that 
      it might be possible to compile and use the plugin under other VLC supported 
      operating systems that also have eDonkey/eMule clients (such as Linux/MacOS).
  <li>The plugin is now built using the Cygwin environment under Windows as 
      recommended by the VideoLAN developers. Refer to the build instructions 
      within the source package for details.

<h3>27-Aug-2003</h3>

  <li>Added: Updated to VLC v0.6.2.
  <li>Added: Exception handler to ensue that due to a crash while reading a part.met file, the part.met file always gets closed again.
