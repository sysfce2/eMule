<h1>README - eMule part file access module for VideoLAN Client v1.0.5</h1>

<h2>Quickstart</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Download and install VideoLAN Client (VLC) v1.0.5 from
    <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">http://www.videolan.org/vlc/</a>
  <li>Extract the eMule part file access module package and run the included 
      setup_partfileplugin.msi <span class="style1"><strong>or</strong></span> copy the
    <strong>libaccess_partfile_plugin.dll</strong> file into the plugin directory
    of your VLC installation, e.g. <strong>C:\Program
    Files\VideoLAN\VLC\plugins</strong>
  <li>Open the eMule <strong>Options-&gt;Files</strong> dialog and specify
    VLC as the video player which is to be used for previewing part
    files:
      <ul>
        <li>Specify the full path to the executable of VLC, e.g.
          <strong>C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe</strong>
        <li>Disable the option <strong>Create backup to preview</strong>
      </ul>
    <li>Check that the eMule part file access module is properly recognized by
    VLC. See also: <a style="color: red;" href="#CheckInstall"><strong>IMPORTANT
    NOTE</strong></a>
  <li>If you experience lockups/freezes while previewing part files with the
    eMule part file access module, try setting <strong>Allow only one running instance</strong>
    in VLC at <strong>Settings-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Advanced</strong>
    (you have to click the <strong>Advanced options</strong> checkbox
    in the bottom right of the Preferences window to see this option).
    This prevents a separate copy of VLC from being run for each file you preview 
    within eMule; having multiple copies of VLC running at the same time 
    can cause deadlocks while trying to access hardware that's already
    being used/locked by a previous VLC instance.
  <li>When VLC cannot read the index for an AVI file, it offers to 
    recreate the index. If you don't want to be prompted everytime, open 
    <strong>Settings-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Input / Codecs-&gt;Demuxers-&gt;AVI</strong>
    and set <strong>Force index creation</strong> to 
    <strong><em>Never fix</em></strong>.

</ul>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>The purpose of this access module is to provide VideoLAN Client (VLC) with a media stream
out of an eMule part file.</p>
<p>Because an eMule part file usually does not contain a complete media stream,
VLC has to scan the entire file to find all actually available
data. The process of scanning the entire file may take a rather long time,
depending on the actual data available and the file size.</p>
<p>This access module will evaluate the eMule part.met file of the corresponding
part file to determine what file data is actually available. With this information,
the access module is capable of creating a virtual media stream without any gaps
and will feed this media stream right into VLC, and thus VLC will no longer
have to scan the entire file, because it will "see" only the actually available data
in the part file.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>R un the included setup_partfileplugin.msi <span class="style1"><strong>or</strong></span> 
    copy the <strong>libaccess_partfile_plugin.dll</strong> file into the plugin
directory of your VLC installation. e.g. <strong>C:\Program
Files\VideoLAN\VLC\plugins</strong></p>
<p id="CheckInstall"><strong><font color="#ff0000">IMPORTANT
NOTE:</font></strong> After installing the eMule part file access module or
after installing a new version of VLC you should always manually check if the
version of the eMule part file access module matches the version of VLC. This is
because VLC does not support modules which were developed for a different
version of VLC than the installed one. For example, if you are using e.g. VLC
v1.0.5, you cannot use an eMule part file access module which was developed for
e.g. VLC v1.0.4, and vice versa. In other words, <strong><em>the version of VLC must
always match the version of the eMule part file access module</em></strong>.</p>
<p>After copying the module DLL file to the VLC plugins directory, you should
open the VLC Preferences dialog (<strong>Settings-&gt;Preferences</strong>) and check
whether there is an <strong>eMule Part File</strong> module listed in the
<strong>Input / Codecs-&gt;Access Modules</strong> section. If not, your version of VLC does not
match the version of the eMule part file access module. Either upgrade VLC or
the eMule part file access module.</p>
<!--
<p>It is also possible to learn the VLC version required by the installed eMule
part file access module. Check the version information stored in the module DLL,
which can be seen from Windows Explorer's File-&gt;Properties dialog, as shown in
the following screenshot:</p>
<img alt="eMule part file access module version information" src="file_version.png">
-->

<h2>Uninstallation</h2>

<p>&nbsp;Use the &quot;Programs and Features&quot; dialog or remove the <strong>libaccess_partfile_plugin.dll</strong> file from the
plugin directory of your VLC installation.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Once installed, the part file access module is automatically invoked by VLC
every time a file is opened. If the extension of the opened file is
<strong>.part</strong>, the access module tries to find the according
<strong>.part.met</strong> file and will then handle the part file as described
above. This means that there is no special action required to use the
functionality of the access module. Just open any part file you want to view,
either from eMule (Preview), from within Windows Explorer, or using the Open File
dialog of VLC.</p>
<p>Additionally, when using the VLC Open File dialog or the Windows Explorer
command line, you can specify the part file to be opened with <strong>
partfile://&lt;path&gt;</strong> to make sure that VLC uses the eMule part file
access module.</p>
<p>Example: partfile://D:\eMuleTMP\001.part</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p> The settings dialog for the access module is available within VLC at
<strong>Settings-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Input / Codecs-&gt;Access Modules-&gt;eMule Part File</strong>.</p>

<h3>Seekable streams</h3>
<p>Enabling these options will create
seekable streams, allowing you to use the position slider in VLC to skip around
in the movie or jump to a specific location.</p>
<p>The decision if a part.met file is an AVI or an MPEG file is made by checking
the file extension and other metadata information eMule provides. As this
information is not always 100% correct it may happen that a seekable stream is
created although the corresponding option is not enabled (e.g. you are
downloading a file called "MyVideo.mpg", but the actual format of the
file is of type AVI). Should this occur, you may want to rename the file to its
proper extension in eMule's File Details dialog.</p>

<h3>Enable plugin for MPEG part files</h3>
<p>If this option is enabled, the part file access module will provide a virtual
stream built from the part file if the part file contains MPEG media. Default =
enabled.</p>

<h3>Provide a seekable stream for MPEG part files</h3>
<p>If this option is enabled, the part file access module will provide the
virtual stream built from the part file as a seekable stream. This option
has no effect if the "Enable plugin for MPEG part files" option is disabled.
Default = enabled.</p>

<h3>Enable plugin for AVI part files</h3>
<p>If this option is enabled, the part file access module will provide a virtual
stream built from the part file if the part file contains AVI media. Default =
enabled.</p>

<h3>Provide a seekable stream for AVI part files</h3>
<p>If this option is enabled, the part file access module will provide the
virtual stream built from the part file as a seekable stream. This option
has no effect if the "Enable plugin for AVI part files" option is disabled.
Default = enabled.</p>

<h3>Enable plugin for other (non MPEG or AVI) part files</h3>
<p>If this option is enabled, the part file access module will provide a virtual 
    media stream built from the part file even if the part file does not contain 
    MPEG or AVI media. Use this option to preview other file types (e.g. OGM, MKV, 
    ...) Default = disabled.</p>

<h3>Provide a seekable stream for other (non MPEG or AVI) part files</h3>
<p>If this option is enabled, the part file access module will provide the
virtual stream built from the part file as a seekable stream. This option
has no effect if the "Enable plugin for other (non MPEG or AVI) part files"
option is disabled. Default = disabled.</p>

<h2>File info for eMule part files (ED2K meta data)</h2>

<p>The Stream and Media Info dialog available within VideoLAN Client
(<strong>View-&gt;Stream and Media Info</strong>) shows the file format
parameters determined by VLC and some of the eMule/ED2K meta data.</p>
